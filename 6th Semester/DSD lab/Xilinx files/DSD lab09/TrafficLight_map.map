WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net PS[1]_PWR_8_o_Mux_28_o is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   104 out of   1,430    7%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       260 out of   2,860    9%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          370
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           232 out of     370   62%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              22 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
